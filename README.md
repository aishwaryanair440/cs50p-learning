# CS50 Python – Learning Journey 🐍

This repository documents my learning journey through **CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python (CS50P)** by Harvard University.

I am new to coding, and my goal is to **learn Python fundamentals step by step while documenting my progress publicly**.  
This repo focuses on **learning, practice, notes, and reflections**, not just writing code.

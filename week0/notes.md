# Week 0, Python Basics (CS50P)

- `print()` displays output  
  ```
  print("Hello, world!")
  ```

Variables store data (no type declaration)

```
name = "Anu"
age = 18
```

`input()` takes user input as a string

```
name = input("Enter your name: ")
```

Type conversion changes data type

```
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
```

Example program

```
name = input("What is your name? ")
age = int(input("What is your age? "))
print("Hello,", name)
print("Next year, you will be", age + 1)
```
